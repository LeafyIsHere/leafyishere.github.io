<h3>Katie Triggers Me Psychological Analysis</h3>
<h5>Tuesday, August 2, 2016</h5>
<p>I'm no psychologist but I made some observations while watching Katie's newest video and I would like to outline the observation here.</p>
<p>Katie and her father are opening some sort of anime action figure in this video but I think there is more to it than that. Katie appears to be acting very unusual in the video (more unusual than normal for her) and it seems to be a very awkward situation all together. I observe that Katie does not fully accept her way of life and she tries to act apart from who she is in this video. For example you can see she lacks interest in the product she has purchased. This is a normal human behavior for this kind of situation. Now let's talk about Kate's father, he appears pretty down to earth and I believe he truly loves Katie. Although I believe he thinks Katie's hobbies are a bit strange he still supports her to some extent. Honestly there isn't much to say here but I do have an open statement to Katie.</p>
<p>Katie,<br>I urge you to be yourself to the fullest. Don't mind what other people think about what you like and just be yourself. And don't be afraid to say you love someone; they won't be around forever. You can't live in the past nor the future.<br>-Someone who cares</p>
